          <p class="PageText">SUNLINER are a punk rock band from Leeds, UK. Having toured the world and released highly acclaimed albums as “Jake & The Jellyfish”. 
            J&TJ have changed their name to reflect the natural progression of their music. SUNLINER are gruff, sing-a-long punk rock with folk 
            and hardcore influences and intimate, personal yet relatable lyrics. FFO Hot Water Music and Against Me!. 
            With tours with Red City Radio, shows with Nothington, H2O, Dave Hause, Laura Stevenson, The Skints and slots at FEST (Florida),
            Punk Rock Holiday, Mighty Sounds, Bearded Theory and Kendal Calling they have really carved their foot-hold in the punk rock scene.
            <br>
            <br>
            SUNLINER have now joined LOCKJAW RECORDS (UK) and the PAPER + PLASTICK (US) families to release their 2 new songs ‘Structure’ 
            and ‘Average at Best’. Each song addresses self-doubt, mental health and the struggle to find a life balance, yet being self-aware 
            and catchy hardcore-leaning, pop, punk rock. Singer, Jake shouts ‘The ground’s moving, and I’m spinning plates’ in Average at Best 
            showcasing the feeling of being overwhelmed that we can all relate too. Jake says “I always try and make lyrics personal and to 
            tell an arc, yet want to the listener to feel like I could be talking about them. We all struggle, and all have our worries and 
            problems, I might not be able to fix them, but hopefully we can make people feel even a little less alone.
            <br>
            <br>
            There’s a humour to SUNLINER’s new songs too, Structure opens with the line ‘They say you’ll never work a day, if you do what you 
            love. Well I love not working, and sleeping enough’. An example of the thread of social commentary that’s run through all of 
            SUNLINER’s and J&TJ’s music, criticising societies pressures and hypocrisies and tapping into those experiences and feelings 
            that we all share.
            <br>
            <br>
            The move of SUNLINER to move away from their early folk-punk roots, similar to bands like Against Me! Has allowed the intricacies 
            of the musicianship to shine through, though they have not lost their routes and both songs are high-energy, top of your lungs, 
            punk rock hitters.‘We’re all just flesh and bones and blood’
